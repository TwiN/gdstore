# gdstore

**gdstore**, short for **G**o **D**isk store, is a key-value library in Go for persisting data to disk.

This library does not have speed as its main purpose, but rather, ease of use.

If you're looking for a high-performance key-value store/database/cache, there are definitely better
alternatives, but if you're searching for a simple way to persist key-value entries to disk, then 
this is definitely what you're looking for.
